# Summary for: **Material**  < [MaterialBase](MaterialBase.html)

## Class summary

Material Basic isotropic material class.

Materials are normally instantiated with the static methods

* `Material.create`

* `Material.from_specs`

## Properties

### .Material/**BH_extrapolation_method** is a property.

### .Material/**data** is a property.

### .**iron_loss_computation_method** Iron loss computation method.

This property allows an option to toggle the iron loss
computation method. Indeed, the `loss_density`  method of the
[Material](Material.html) class calls the method with its name equal to this
property.

However, subclasses may have a different `loss_density`  method.
Help for Material/iron_loss_computation_method is inherited from superclass MaterialBase


## Methods

Class methods are listed below. Inherited methods are not included.

### .harmonic-approximation BH-curve (eq. (47) in Arkkio's thesis)

### .Material/**add_domain** is a function.
this = add_domain(this, domain)

### .**clear_copy** New independent copy of the material.

### .**create** Create material

mat = Material.create(material_object)

Return a clear_copy of material_object.

mat = Material.create(matid)

Create a material from library, see get_defaultMaterial

mat = Material.create()

Create an empty Material object.

### .initialize_material_data Calculate reluctivities etc.

Compute reluctivities and extrapolate BH data.

Reluctivity data as a function of B^2 is saved to `this.data` .

### .**detach** Clear elements, domains, etc.

### .**differential_reluctivity** Return reluctivity and its derivative.

[nu, dnu] = differential_reluctivity(this, Bvector, true)

Return reluctivity and its derivative w.r.t. `B` ^2 computed with the
harmonic approximation

[H, dHdB] = differential_reluctivity(this, Bvector)

Return magnetic field strength vector and the differential reluctivity
tensor. Only works in 2D.

### .extrapolate_BH_langevin Extrapolate BH data with constant magnetization.

[Bext, Hext] = extrapolate_BH_langevin(B, H) extrapolate given BH data by
assuming a constant magnetization beyond the given range.

Returns original BH data appended by extrapolated data.

### .**extrapolate_BH_data** Extrapolate given BH data.

[Bext, Hext]  = extrapolate_BH_data(this, B, H) extrapolate BH data with
the method specified in this.BH_extrapolation_method:

* 'langevin' : fitting a single Langevin function to the data, using
Material.extrapolate_BH_langevin

* 'constant' : extrapolate using constant magnetization equal to the
last datapoint in the given BH data. Uses Material.extrapolate_BH_constant

* 'linear' : linear extrapolation of BH curve. Uses Material.extrapolate_BH_linear

* for other approaches, please subclass Material.

Returns original BH data appended by extrapolated data.

### .**extrapolate_BH_langevin** Extrapolate BH data with Langevin approach.

[Bext, Hext] = extrapolate_BH_langevin(B, H) extrapolate given BH data by
fitting the single-valued Langevin function to the data; specifically by
matching the value and slope at the end of the given BH curve.

Returns original BH data appended by extrapolated data.

### .**extrapolate_BH_linear** Extrapolate BH data with linear extrapolation.


Returns original BH data appended by extrapolated data.

### .**fit_Langevin1** Process BH data with Langevin approach.

fit_Langevin1(this)

Process given BH data (this.B, this.H). Given data range is used as
such. Extrapolation to higher flux densities is performed by fitting
the single Langevin function to the data, and using it for
extrapolation.

fit_Langevin1(this, 'monotonicity_factor', c)

Additional improve the reluctivity-monotonicity of the given data with
the following approach:

1. Compute nu = H / B

2. Make nu monotonic.

3. Compute H_monotonic = nu * B

4. Replace H := (1-c)*H_original + c*H_monotonic.

5. Proceeed as earlier.

Even a small monotonicity factor can often improve the convergence of
nonlinear problems.

NOTE: Original BH data is not modified.

### .**from_specs** Create material from specs.

Call syntax:

mat = Material.from_specs('name', name, 'B', B_curve_vector,
'H', H_curve_vector, 'property_name_1', value_1, ...)

### .**init_for_problem** Initialize object for problem.

Normally, this method does very little apart from determining the
stacking factors. It could be used to initialize hysteresis models or
similar in subclasses on Material, though.

### .**initialize_material_data** Initialize reluctivity curves etc.

initialize_material_data(this)

Process given BH data (this.B, this.H). Given data range is used as
such. Extrapolation to higher flux densities is performed by
this.extrapolate_BH_data

initialize_material_data(this, 'monotonicity_factor', c)

Additional improve the reluctivity-monotonicity of the given data with
the following approach:

1. Compute nu = H / B

2. Make nu monotonic.

3. Compute H_monotonic = nu * B

4. Replace H := (1-c)*H_original + c*H_monotonic.

5. Proceeed as earlier.

Even a small monotonicity factor can often improve the convergence of
nonlinear problems.

NOTE: Original BH data is not modified.

### .**iron_loss_density_frequency_domain_Bertotti** Iron loss density computed
with the frequency-domain Bertotti model.

WARNING: make sure the that the solution used contains a full fundamental
period of the flux density waveforms.

WARNING: many concentrated winding configurations result in sub-harmonics
in the rotor field. In this case, multiple electrical periods should be
analysed, and the `use_entire_solution`  keyword argument set to `true`
when calling MaterialBase.losses.

### .**iron_loss_density_time_domain_Steinmetz** Iron loss density from modified Steinmetz
model.

[p_hysteresis, p_eddy, p_excess] =
iron_loss_density_time_domain_Steinmetz(this, Bdata), where

* Bdata : flux density data structure returned from
`MaterialBase.get_B_data` .

The loss components are computed as follows:

p_hysteresis = hysteresis loss density = ch ** abs(Bx^a **  dBx/dt^b) +
abs(By^a * dBy/dt^b)

where a=b=1 by default, if not given in
this.material_properties.steinmetz_exponents = 1x2 vector

p_eddy = eddy loss density = ce * ( (dBx/dt)^2 + (dBy/dt)^2 )

p_excess = c_ex * (dBx/dt)^1.5 + (dBy/dt)^1.5

WARNING: For now, the method also supports a legacy syntax, with the
input arguments (this, timestamps, Bx, By). This syntax is used by the
[time_domain_Steinmetz](time_domain_Steinmetz.html) function. In this case, the returned loss densities are in
W/kg.

### .**plot_BH** Plot BH curves etc.

### .Material.**process_BH** is a function.
[Bnu, Bdnu] = Material.process_BH(BH, varargin)

### .**raw_reluctivity** Evaluate (non-differential) reluctivity.

nu = raw_reluctivity(this, B2)

### .**save_to_excel** Save material specs to Excel.

### .**set_step** Set new time-step.

set_step(this, kstep, t, varargin)

Does nothing by default

### .Material/**shift_elements** is a function.
this = shift_elements(this, Ne)
