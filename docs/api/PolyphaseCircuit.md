# Summary for: **PolyphaseCircuit**  < [Circuit](Circuit.html) & [SliceableCircuit](SliceableCircuit.html)

## Class summary

PolyphaseCircuit Class for finite-element representation of polyphase
circuits.

this = PolyphaseCircuit(name, winding_spec)

Returns a new PolyphaseCircuit object with the given name
and associated with the [PolyphaseWindingSpec](PolyphaseWindingSpec.html) winding
specification.

A PolyphaseCircuit is largely characterized by its `winding_spec`
property = a [PolyphaseWindingSpec](PolyphaseWindingSpec.html) object. This winding
specification object contains information such as number of turns and
parallel paths, winding layout matrix, loop matrix, etc.

The PolyphaseCircuit then handles the finite-element representation
of the winding, as well as the different supply modes. See
`this.set_load` .

NOT exactly the 'textbook back-emf' which is often understood
to include only the PM flux.

### .**phase_impedance_voltage_drop** Phase voltage drops from
solution.

The voltage drop includes the reactive voltage drop in the
end-winding, and the resistive voltage drop over conductors
modelled as stranded (normally either the entire winding if
this.winding_spec.winding_model_type = defs.stranded, or just
the end-winding region in case defs.solid).

Phase resistance matrix as seen from the phase terminals,
i.e. considering the effect of parallel paths.

### .**phase_voltage** Phase voltages from the solution.

Returns the phase voltages = potential differences as
measured between the ends of each phase. For typical
star-connected machines, this would be the line-to-neutral
voltages; for typical delta-connected motors they are the
line-to-line voltages.

Or, expressed more exactly, the "phase voltage" of each phase
is the sum of the voltages over all the individual coils
belonging to a certain phase. The voltage includes both the
induced voltage (dPhi/dt) and voltage drop over lumped
impedances.

U = phase_voltage(this, solution, varargin)

### .**results_summary** Summary of important results.

out = results_summary(this, solution) computes quantities such as phase

### .**set_load**1 Increment load vector.

set_parent(this, parent)

### .**set_source** Set circuit source.

set_source(this, source_type, source)

Set the winding source, see below.

source_type : string specifying source type:

* 'uniform coil current' : Uses the specified coil current, distributed
uniformly over the conductor [Domain](Domain.html) areas. Works for any analysis
type.

* 'terminal current source' : Specifies the net terminal current.

* 'terminal voltage' : Specifies the potential (V) at each terminal,
with respect to an arbitrary reference point. For harmonic/stepping
analysis only.

* 'circuit' :

source : Source values:

* phases x steps array : used directly as such.

* function handle : typically to VoltageSource.U method

it makes.
