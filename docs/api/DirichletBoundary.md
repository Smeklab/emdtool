## Class summary

DirichletBoundary methods:
DirichletBoundary - is a class.
parse_from_gmsh_surface - DirichletBoundary/parse_from_gmsh_surface is a function.
plot - DirichletBoundary/plot is a function.

## Properties


## Methods

Class methods are listed below. Inherited methods are not included.

### .**DirichletBoundary**/DirichletBoundary is a constructor.
obj = DirichletBoundary
Documentation for DirichletBoundary/DirichletBoundary
doc DirichletBoundary

### .DirichletBoundary.**from_gmsh_surface** is a function.
this = DirichletBoundary.from_gmsh_surface(mesh, surface)

### .DirichletBoundary/**parse_from_gmsh_surface** is a function.
parse_from_gmsh_surface(this, surface)

### .PLOT   Linear **plot**.
PLOT(X,Y) plots vector Y versus vector X. If X or Y is a matrix,
then the vector is plotted versus the rows or columns of the matrix,
whichever line up.  If X is a scalar and Y is a vector, disconnected
line objects are created and plotted as discrete points vertically at
X.

PLOT(Y) plots the columns of Y versus their index.
If Y is complex, PLOT(Y) is equivalent to PLOT(real(Y),imag(Y)).
In all other uses of PLOT, the imaginary part is ignored.

Various line types, **plot** symbols and colors may be obtained with
PLOT(X,Y,S) where S is a character string made from one element
from any or all the following 3 columns:

b     blue          .     point              -     solid
g     green         o     circle             :     dotted
r     red           x     x-mark             -.    dashdot
c     cyan          +     plus               --    dashed
m     magenta       *     star             (none)  no line
y     yellow        s     square
k     black         d     diamond
w     white         v     triangle (down)
^     triangle (up)
<     triangle (left)
>     triangle (right)
p     pentagram
h     hexagram

For example, PLOT(X,Y,'c+:') plots a cyan dotted line with a plus
at each data point; PLOT(X,Y,'bd') plots blue diamond at each data
point but does not draw any line.

PLOT(TBL,XVAR,YVAR) plots the variables xvar and yvar from the table
tbl. To **plot** one data set, specify one variable for xvar and one
variable for yvar. To **plot** multiple data sets, specify multiple
variables for xvar, yvar, or both. If both arguments specify multiple
variables, they must specify the same number of variables

PLOT(TBL,YVAR) plots the specified variable from the table against the
row indices in the table. If the table is a timetable, the specified
variable is plotted against the row times from the timetable.

PLOT(X1,Y1,S1,X2,Y2,S2,X3,Y3,S3,...) combines the plots defined by
the (X,Y,S) triples, where the X's and Y's are vectors or matrices
and the S's are strings.

For example, PLOT(X,Y,'y-',X,Y,'go') plots the data twice, with a
solid yellow line interpolating green circles at the data points.

The PLOT command, if no color is specified, makes automatic use of
the colors specified by the axes ColorOrder property.  By default,
PLOT cycles through the colors in the ColorOrder property.  For
monochrome systems, PLOT cycles over the axes LineStyleOrder property.

Note that RGB colors in the ColorOrder property may differ from
similarly-named colors in the (X,Y,S) triples.  For example, the
second axes ColorOrder property is medium green with RGB [0 .5 0],
while PLOT(X,Y,'g') plots a green line with RGB [0 1 0].

If you do not specify a marker type, PLOT uses no marker.
If you do not specify a line style, PLOT uses a solid line.

PLOT(AX,...) plots into the axes with handle AX.

PLOT returns a column vector of handles to lineseries objects, one
handle per plotted line.

The X,Y pairs, or X,Y,S triples, can be followed by
parameter/value pairs to specify additional properties
of the lines. For example, PLOT(X,Y,'LineWidth',2,'Color',[.6 0 0])
will create a **plot** with a dark red line width of 2 points.

Example
x = -pi:pi/10:pi;
y = tan(sin(x)) - sin(tan(x));
plot(x,y,'--rs','LineWidth',2,...
'MarkerEdgeColor','k',...
'MarkerFaceColor','g',...
'MarkerSize',10)
