### * ProxyObject/get_id is a function.
idd = get_id(this)

### * ProxyObject/get_proxies is a function.
ps = get_proxies(this)

### * ProxyObject/set_id is a function.
set_id(this, v)

### * UNIQUE Set unique.
C = UNIQUE(A) for the array A returns the same values as in A but with
no repetitions. C will be sorted.

C = UNIQUE(A,'rows') for the matrix A returns the **unique** rows of A.
The rows of the matrix C will be in sorted order.

[C,IA,IC] = UNIQUE(A) also returns index vectors IA and IC such that
C = A(IA) and A = C(IC) (or A(:) = C(IC), if A is a matrix or array).

[C,IA,IC] = UNIQUE(A,'rows') also returns index vectors IA and IC such
that C = A(IA,:) and A = C(IC,:).

[C,IA,IC] = UNIQUE(A,OCCURRENCE) and
[C,IA,IC] = UNIQUE(A,'rows',OCCURRENCE) specify which index is returned
in IA in the case of repeated values (or rows) in A. The default value
is OCCURRENCE = 'first', which returns the index of the first occurrence
of each repeated value (or row) in A, while OCCURRENCE = 'last' returns
the index of the last occurrence of each repeated value (or row) in A.

[C,IA,IC] = UNIQUE(A,'stable') returns the values of C in the same order
that they appear in A, while [C,IA,IC] = UNIQUE(A,'sorted') returns the
values of C in sorted order. If A is a row vector, then C will be a row
vector as well, otherwise C will be a column vector. IA and IC are
column vectors. If there are repeated values in A, then IA returns the
index of the first occurrence of each repeated value.

[C,IA,IC] = UNIQUE(A,'rows','stable') returns the rows of C in the same
order that they appear in A, while [C,IA,IC] = UNIQUE(A,'rows','sorted')
returns the rows of C in sorted order.

The behavior of UNIQUE has changed.  This includes:
-	occurrence of indices in IA and IC switched from last to first
-	IA and IC will always be column index vectors

If this change in behavior has adversely affected your code, you may
preserve the previous behavior with:

[C,IA,IC] = UNIQUE(A,'legacy')
[C,IA,IC] = UNIQUE(A,'rows','legacy')
[C,IA,IC] = UNIQUE(A,OCCURRENCE,'legacy')
[C,IA,IC] = UNIQUE(A,'rows',OCCURRENCE,'legacy')

Examples:

a = [9 9 9 9 9 9 8 8 8 8 7 7 7 6 6 6 5 5 4 2 1]

[c1,ia1,ic1] = unique(a)
% returns
c1 = [1 2 4 5 6 7 8 9]
ia1 = [21 20 19 17 14 11 7 1]'
ic1 = [8 8 8 8 8 8 7 7 7 7 6 6 6 5 5 5 4 4 3 2 1]'

[c2,ia2,ic2] = unique(a,'stable')
% returns
c2 = [9 8 7 6 5 4 2 1]
ia2 = [1 7 11 14 17 19 20 21]'
ic2 = [1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 5 5 6 7 8]'

c = unique([1 NaN NaN 2])
% NaNs compare as not equal, so this returns
c = [1 2 NaN NaN]

Class support for input A:
- logical, char, all numeric classes
- cell arrays of strings
-- 'rows' option is not supported for cell arrays
- objects with methods SORT (SORTROWS for the 'rows' option) and NE
-- including heterogeneous arrays
