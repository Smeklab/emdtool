## Summary
defs is a class.
## PROPERTIES
## Methods
Class methods are listed below. Inherited methods are not included.
### * Isolated conductor with a zero net current.

### * Squirrel-cage circuit

### * Cellstr conversion for enumeration classes
### * Char conversion for enumeration classes
### * defs.current_supply is a function.
e = current_supply

### * defs.current_supply_dynamic is a function.
e = current_supply_dynamic

### * Conductor belonging to (non-squirrel-cage) **damper** winding.

### * defs.decomposed is a function.
e = decomposed

### * defs/defs is a constructor.

### * ==  Equal.
A == B does element by element comparisons between A and B and returns
an array with elements set to logical 1 (TRUE) where the relation is
true and elements set to logical 0 (FALSE) where it is not. A and B
must have compatible sizes. In the simplest cases, they can be the same
size or one can be a scalar. Two inputs have compatible sizes if, for
every dimension, the dimension sizes of the inputs are either the same
or one of them is 1.

C = EQ(A,B) is called for the syntax 'A == B' when A or B is an object.

### * Conductor belonging to field-winding

### * intersect for enumeration classes
### * ismember for enumeration classes
### * ~=  Not equal.
A ~= B does element by element comparisons between A and B and returns
an array with elements set to logical 1 (TRUE) where the relation is
true and elements set to logical 0 (FALSE) where it is not. A and B
must have compatible sizes. In the simplest cases, they can be the same
size or one can be a scalar. Two inputs have compatible sizes if, for
every dimension, the dimension sizes of the inputs are either the same
or one of them is 1.

C = NE(A,B) is called for the syntax 'A ~= B' when A or B is an object.

### * defs.none is a function.
e = none

### * Circuit connected to an external **polyphase** (>=1) circuit

### * setdiff for enumeration classes
### * setxor for enumeration classes
### * Conductor with a zero net current, extending over the entire
cross-section.

### * Conductor belonging to a sheet, with an additional 1D end-ring
outside the 2D geometry.

### * strcmp for enumeration classes
### * strcmpi for enumeration classes
### * string conversion for enumeration classes
### * strncmp for enumeration classes
### * strncmpi for enumeration classes
### * union for enumeration classes
### * defs.user_defined is a function.
e = user_defined
