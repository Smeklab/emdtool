# Summary for: **SlottedRotorBase**  < [RadialGeometry](RadialGeometry.html)

## Class summary

SlottedRotorBase Base class for slotted radial-flux rotors.

This class doesn't contain any geometry-creation functionality
(this.mesh_geometry). Symmetry sector angles etc. are determinated
from the slot number (dimensions.Qr) and number of symmetry sectors
(dimensions.symmetry_sectors).
