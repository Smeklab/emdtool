# Summary for: **order_edges**

**order_edges** orders edges.

When given a 2xN array of edges (defined by end-nodes), function
sorted_edges = **order_edges**(bnd_edges)
tries to order the edges in such a way that a polygon is formed.
Generally, it only works then the given edges can be formed into a closed
loop.
