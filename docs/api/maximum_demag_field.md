# Summary for: **maximum_demag_field**

**maximum_demag_field** Maximum instantaneous demagnetization field across geometry.

Hdemag = **maximum_demag_field**(solution)

Hdemag = **maximum_demag_field**(solution, key, val, ...) with the following
options:

* 'output', 'relative'/'absolute' : Express demagnetization field as
either A/m or as percentage (100 % -based) of magnet grade HcJ.
Default: relative.
