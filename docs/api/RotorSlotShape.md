# Summary for: **RotorSlotShape**  < [SlotShapeBase](SlotShapeBase.html) & [WoundSlot](WoundSlot.html)

## Class summary

RotorSlotShape Base class for rotor slots.

So far does not differ at all from [SlotShapeBase](SlotShapeBase.html) - will change in
future releases.

## Properties

### .**has_opening** Does the slot have a slot opening

this.has_opening is `true` if the slot shape as a slot opening
(either real or all-steel virtual surface), and thus
`this.airgap_surface_curves` is non-empty. If `this.has_opening`
is `false`, then the slot does not touch the airgap at all, and
all its surfaces appear as `holes` in the parent surface.
Help for RotorSlotShape/has_opening is inherited from superclass SlotShapeBase
