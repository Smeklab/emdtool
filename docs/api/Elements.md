### .Cellstr conversion for enumeration classes

### .Char conversion for enumeration classes

### .==  Equal.
A == B does element by element comparisons between A and B and returns
an array with elements set to logical 1 (TRUE) where the relation is
true and elements set to logical 0 (FALSE) where it is not. A and B
must have compatible sizes. In the simplest cases, they can be the same
size or one can be a scalar. Two inputs have compatible sizes if, for
every dimension, the dimension sizes of the inputs are either the same
or one of them is 1.

C = EQ(A,B) is called for the syntax 'A == B' when A or B is an object.

### .**intersect** for enumeration classes

### .**isequal** for enumerations, including support for string/char vector/cellstr comparisons

### .**isequaln** for enumerations, including support for string/char vector/cellstr comparisons

### .**isequalwithequalnans** for enumerations, including support for string/char vector/cellstr comparisons

### .**ismember** for enumeration classes

### .~=  Not equal.
A ~= B does element by element comparisons between A and B and returns
an array with elements set to logical 1 (TRUE) where the relation is
true and elements set to logical 0 (FALSE) where it is not. A and B
must have compatible sizes. In the simplest cases, they can be the same
size or one can be a scalar. Two inputs have compatible sizes if, for
every dimension, the dimension sizes of the inputs are either the same
or one of them is 1.

C = NE(A,B) is called for the syntax 'A ~= B' when A or B is an object.
