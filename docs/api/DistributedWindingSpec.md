Length of end-winding per coil side, relative to the ideal length
span ** 2** pi/number_of_slots * average slot radius

### .DistributedWindingSpec/**layer_direction** is a property.

### .half_of_turn_length

### .**q** - number of slots per pole and phase

### .DistributedWindingSpec/**type** is a property.
