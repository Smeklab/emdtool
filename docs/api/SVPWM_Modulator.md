### * RESET  Reset graphics object properties to their defaults.
RESET(H) resets all properties having factory defaults on the object
identified by handle H to their default values. If h is a figure, MATLAB
does not **reset** PaperPosition, PaperUnits, Position, Units or WindowStyle.
If h is an axes, MATLAB does not **reset** Position and Units.

For example,
RESET(GCA) resets the properties of the current axis.
RESET(GCF) resets the properties of the current figure.
