EMDtool circuit analysis is largely based on the mesh current / loop current method, as it plays so well along with finite element analysis.

The Paint nightmare below is my illustration of the three cases. All pics:

* Thick black lines: three motor phases, connected in star
    * From the circuit analysis point of view, the finite-element part really appears as voltage sources and resistances in series with them (resistances not illustrated here)
    * For stranded windings, the voltage term is computed from the time-derivative of flux linkage, while the resistance part includes the entire phase resistance (end-winding and active-part combined)
    * For solid-conductor windings, the "voltage" term is an extra unknown/degree-of-freedom to be solved, and contains both the induced voltage and resistive voltage drop in the active part of the machine. Only the end-winding resistances would appear in the circuit diagram here.
* Blue: supply voltages
* Thin black lines: inverter-to-motor connections
* Red: virtual loop currents
* Resistances are ignored for simplicity. Currently, EMDtool easily supports only "FE resistances", so motor resistances and none on the lines or in the source. 
Line resistances can be jury-rigged assuming the circuit is simple as in the pics, if needed.

The first pic demonstrates a normal three-phase connection. If we assume the voltage source is an inverter, then the star point of the source would correspond to the "ground bus" of 
the inverter (is there a better term?), and each of the blue voltage sources would be one half bridge. As everything is in star, only two loops are formed.

To illustrate how the circuit equations are formed, we have to consider two things:

1. The motor phase currents (IA, IB, IC) are now not independent, but depend on the loop currents I1 and I2. We can write

[IA; IB; IC] = [1 0;0 1; -1 -1] * [I1; I2]

Let's call the 3x2 matrix above L. This is the matrix that is returned by the independent current matrix method of PolyphaseWindingSpec.

2. On the other hand, we also know that the sum of voltages in both of the loops must equal zero. Let V denote the "finite-element voltages" (black sources) and U denote the supply sources (blue circles). Then, we have

VA - VC = -UC + UA

VB - VC = -UC + UB

Or, in matrix form we can write this as

L^T * [VA; VB; VC] = L^T [UA; UB; UC]

In other words, the same matrix L that relates the loop currents to the phase currents, also (as a transpose) relates the FE-voltages to the loop voltages. 
Technically, the same matrix does not have to appear on the supply-side; instead the |PolyphaseWindingSpec.line_to_line_voltage_matrix| is used for that.
