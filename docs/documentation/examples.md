# EMDtool Examples

Under this page, you can find multiple example scripts on how `EMDtool` works and can be used for common problems. The same exercises are shipped with the `EMDtool` download package,
and can also be found in the [documentation repository](https://github.com/Smeklab/emdtool/tree/main/Examples).
