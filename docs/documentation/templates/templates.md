# Templates

`EMDtool` preferentially works with _templates_ - parametric models for stators and rotors (and others). Templates allow describing the geometry with a low number of parameters, and easily creating different combinations
of stator and rotor topologies, for instance.

Below (in the Table of Contents section) you can find some useful links, to popular built-in `EMDtool` templates as well as instructions for creating your own templates.
